# TODO:

- [ ] Image transform
    - [ ] Pan
    - [ ] Zoom
        - [ ] (I think zooming in on details might be more fun than just the straight comic covers)
- [ ] Style the labels more
    - [ ] Make them nicer
    - [ ] Fix the awkward fade
    - [ ] Maybe add logos if you're zooming in on covers?
    - [ ] Config start and end issue number, not just a single string
    - [ ] Configure ability to add multiple groups of issues
    - [ ] Maybe "name override" appears below main name, so we can have miniseries names but keep the top group name
        - [ ] Which can be done with a logo
        - [ ] Maybe we do multiple versions of the FF logo in that case?
        - [ ] And this also lets us bounce between the ff vol 3 numbering and the original numbering
